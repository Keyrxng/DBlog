<h1 class="text-2xl" style="text-align: center;">MVP: Achieved - What's next?</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</h1>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><br>The NFT is a browser rendered SVG that is composed on-chain from the token metadata which can be modified post-deployment. Openzeppelin has a useful library for encoding Base64 data which allowed me to create the SVG object.</p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Challenges involved?</strong></p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><br>Finding a way to pass in HTML which could then easily be rendered in whatever customizable styles I defined was tricky but fun. Ultimately '&lt;foreignObject&gt;' was the catalyst in offering me the ability to pass in arbitrary HTML and allow styles to be applied on the front end making it totally customizable client-side.</p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Doesn't that defeat the purpose?</strong></p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><br>I believe that it adds a layer of utility or customization in that it can be rendered into anything in any style, format, or layout that the viewer wants. The content remains the same, but it can be reprocessed to suit any display needs.</p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><strong>But why?</strong></p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><br>Initially the idea and design were built around having a personalised CMS for blogging and content writing in an attempt to improve my social presence and standing. As the project took shape, I began to envision plenty of ways that I could continue to improve on the idea and shape it to facilitate multiple users, introduce paywalls or access restriction gated via NFT ownership and facilitating more creator and consumer ownership rights.</p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><strong>MVP Achieved, what next?</strong></p>
<p class="text-white" style="text-align: center;"><br>Only time will tell, this minimum viable product is good for now and will seek to obtain feedback from peers on ways in which I can improve and things I can work on to increase both my frontend skills alongside, more importantly in my opinion, my smart contract knowledge and ability.</p>
